Welcome to my interactive 2.5D portfolio! 

Here I highlight my experience and some of the projects I'm working on in a fun and interactive way. I hope you enjoy learning more about me! 

You can play through it [here](https://f1nn3g4n.github.io/portfolio/).

This is currently a work in progress!

Largely inspired by [JSLegendDev](https://github.com/JSLegendDev/2d-portfolio-kaboom).
